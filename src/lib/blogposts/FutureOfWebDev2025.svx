## Introduction
Web development is evolving rapidly, with new technologies shaping how developers build and deploy applications. In 2025, trends like AI-driven development, WebAssembly, and edge computing are redefining the landscape.

## Key Trends

### 1. AI-Powered Development
Artificial Intelligence is assisting developers in writing code, debugging, and optimizing performance. Tools like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT are making development faster and more efficient.

### 2. WebAssembly (WASM)
WebAssembly allows developers to write high-performance web applications using languages like Rust and C++. This makes web apps faster and more efficient, rivaling native applications.

### 3. Edge Computing
Edge computing reduces latency by processing data closer to the user. Technologies like Cloudflare Workers and AWS Lambda@Edge are driving this shift.

### 4. Progressive Web Apps (PWA)
PWAs continue to gain traction, offering native-like experiences while remaining accessible through browsers. With improved offline capabilities, they are a strong alternative to traditional apps.

## The Rise of Low-Code and No-Code
Businesses are adopting low-code and no-code platforms to accelerate development. These tools empower non-developers to build applications, reducing the dependency on traditional coding.

## Conclusion
The future of web development is shaped by performance optimizations, AI-driven automation, and a focus on user experience. Developers should stay updated and embrace these advancements to stay competitive.
